## Using Ansible to configure containers

The files in this section have to do with ansible, and the configuration of the variety of containers used.
Inside the Roles directory, you can find the different playbooks used to create the elastic stack server container, as well as the DVWA web server containers, and the setup files for filebeat and metricbeat.
Inside the Files directory, you can find the edited configuration files for both filebeat and metricbeat, as described in the original readme.
